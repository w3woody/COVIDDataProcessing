# Cached Data

This is a store of intermediate processed results, in CSV format. This is done because it takes my computer several minutes to scan the health records, and rather than keep doing that I'd rather store intermediate results here.

## Data Stored:

### hinteraction

This file contains a CSV file with the following records:

- REGISTRANT\_CODE

- ER - # of ER visits by this registrant code
- HOSPITAL - # of hospital visits by this registrant code
- OUTPATIENT - # of outpatient visits by this registrant code
- TELEHEALTH - # of telehealth calls by this registrant code

This is basically a summary of the HEALTHCARE_VISITS in the `data/consolidated\_health\_checkin.csv` file, and is generated by Report1.java.
