# Data

This is where the data is expected to be placed from the parser.

The data here should be downloaded from [this site](https://icandecide.org/v-safe-data/), and decompressed into five CSV files:

- consolidated_vaccinations[1].csv- Consolidated_health_checkin_u3[1].csv- consolidated_health_checkin.csv- consolidated_race_ethnicity[1].csv- consolidated_registrants[1].csv

(These are the file names that the .zip files decompress to. Note: the `consolidated_health_checkin.csv` file is rediculously large and the default Mac archival utility barfs on the file. I had to use [The Unarchiver](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-unarchiver/id425424353?mt=12) to successfully decompress the file.)

Note that the files are not included in this GitHub repository because of their size.
